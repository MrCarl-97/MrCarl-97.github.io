CS5610 Web Dev Assignments

What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
    The most challenging part is the layout. The elements are not at the place I thought they need to be at the most of the times. Have to figure out how to move the position of the divs to the correct places.


What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
    Use the media query. When the window is smaller than a certain size, it will shrink the items to fit the mobile size window. Also, the original code also put the most of the items via the visual heights and the percentage of the window size. So even if without the media query, most of the things should still shows correctly on the mobile.


What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
    Not so much at the moment. But I am consdering add more animations and the videos to the site. It will makes site more lively and the visitor will feel the site is not abandoned.


Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
    Basically, a better background and more resposive design. Such as when scroll the page, some items will be changed relatively. But I do not think most of that can be done under only HTML and CSS. Need to learn more of them.
